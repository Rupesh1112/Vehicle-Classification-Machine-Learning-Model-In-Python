# Vehicle-Classification-Machine-Learning-Model-In-Python
This is my first GitHub Repository. The code is to classify the vehicles based on geometric features into four classes using Logistic regression, LDA, QDA, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors and Tree based methods.
vehicle.csv contains the large number of vehicles data with 18 geometric features.
vehicle_mean.csv and vehicle_median.csv files are nothing but replacement of missing values by mean and median of the feauture values respectively
